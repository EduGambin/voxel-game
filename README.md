# Voxel Game

This is a simple voxel game I made long time ago using C++, OpenGL and the GLM library.

## Usage
Ensure you have the OpenGL, GLM, and GLFW libraries installed in your system. Clone the repository, and then run
```bash
cd voxel-game
make run
```

## Contributing

This is an old project, so there is not really a reason to contribute. If you still want to, you can by creating a pull request
